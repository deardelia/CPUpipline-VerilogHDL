# CPUpipline-VerilogHDL
(this project comes from the course project related to 'computer system and structure')

## Overview
The basic language used in this project is Verilog and it is designed to handle the MIPS-based Instructions such as {nop, jr, addu, subu, slt, beq, addiu, ori, lui, lw, sw, j, jal}

This project consists of the 5-stage pipeline CPU, and has an instruction-set and datacache. \

## Instruction
./code: include the source code related to the 5-stage pipline cpu

./help: include a .py program which can generate the test sample automatically

./test: include a test sample
